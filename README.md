# Diamond_Perfumes
My First Dev Project.(it is an e-commerce website for selling perfumes :).




Start with index.html.    i.e. open idex using internet explorer or what ever browser you want to use.
The project Still requires a lot of work to do.
I have not done the back end till now but hope you guys will understant i have my mid sem round the corner i will surely complete it later.
I want to make a database base also that saves the input from the user and add cookies for BETTER EXPERIENCE OF THE USER ;).
